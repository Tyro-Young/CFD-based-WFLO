# CFD-based WFLO
Optimization framework for designing wind farms using computational fluid dynamics.

A description of the framework can be found in the following papers:

Enrico G.A. Antonini, David A. Romero, Cristina H. Amon. "Continuous adjoint formulation for wind farm layout optimization: A 2D implementation", Applied Energy, 2018;

Enrico G.A. Antonini, David A. Romero, Cristina H. Amon. "Optimal design of wind farms in complex terrains using computational fluid dynamics and adjoint methods", Applied Energy, 2020.

OpenFOAM 6 and NLopt need to be installed as they are fundamental components of the framework.
