Optimization framework for designing wind farms using computational fluid dynamics

A description of the framework is described in the following papers.

Enrico G.A. Antonini, David A. Romero, Cristina H. Amon. "Continuous adjoint formulation for wind farm layout optimization: A 2D implementation", Applied Energy, 2018.

Enrico G.A. Antonini, David A. Romero, Cristina H. Amon. "Optimal Design of Wind Farms in Complex Terrains using Computational Fluid Dynamics and Adjoint Methods", under review.

OpenFOAM 6 and NLopt need to be installed as they are fundamental components of the framework.
